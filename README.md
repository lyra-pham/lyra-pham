# 👋 Hey there, I’m Lyra Pham!  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 🧠 **Data Enthusiast**: I talk to numbers more than people. Sometimes, they even talk back (that’s called data analysis).  
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: Data Science, because making machines smarter than me sounds like a solid life goal. I am also learning French, Bonjour!
- 🤝 **Looking to Collaborate On**: AI and Data Science—because why let Skynet take over when we can do it first?  

### 🎮 Fun Stuff  
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: My strategic thinking is next level. I apply my **StarCraft** skills to real life: "Expand early, control the map, and always have a backup plan (or at least a Zerg rush)."  
- 🎮 **Gaming Arsenal**:  
  - **StarCraft** (where I pretend to be a pro)  
  - **League of Legends** (where my teammates definitely blame me for losing)  
  - **No Man’s Sky** (because space is cool and I need an escape from debugging nightmares)  

### 🔍 More About Me  
- 😄 **Pronouns**: She/Her  
- 🛠️ **Secret Skill**: Debugging my own life is harder than debugging code, but I’m working on it.

🚀 **Let’s make machines work for us before they rise up against us!** 🚀
